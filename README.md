# TeVi
Project for Web Technology course:</br>
TeVi is a flexible Web data visualizer regarding worldwide terrorism, based on our own RESTful API. The statistics and maps can be exported as PNG, SVG, CSV and the charts have been done using amCharts. The system offers support for multi-criterial filters for graphically representing the desired reported incidents. Moreover, the website comes with an admin page, only accessible by logging in, that handles DML operations on the database and manages privileges for any signed up user. Its purpose is to both help specialists and inform the public regarding terrorist attacks from the past 50 years.
